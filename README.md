# Movie-Recommendation-System 
This is a responsive and interactive Movie Recommendation System built using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, which utilizes the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to fetch and display popular movies
and real-time search results. The system initially loads trending movies based on popularity and
allows users to search for any movie title. For each result, it showcases essential details such as
the movie poster, title, average rating, and a brief overview. Ratings are color-coded to indicate
their quality (green for high-rated, orange for moderate, and red for low-rated movies). The design
is sleek and modern, enhanced with hover effects and a movie overview overlay. The project
demonstrates API integration, dynamic DOM manipulation, asynchronous JavaScript (using fetch and
async/await), and a responsive frontend UI with a clean layout. It's a beginner-friendly yet
feature-rich project suitable for showcasing skills in web development, API handling, and UI/UX
design. ðŸ”— [Live Demo](https://polapranithkumarreddy.github.io/Movie-Recommendation-System/)
